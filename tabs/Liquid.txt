F Fmaj7 F7
Bb Gm Am Bb

Remember when you were a kid
The simple things were what mattered most
And time will change a man his dreams and hopes
Would slowly fade away

We sit in space all day
And your childhood fears will drift away
And suddenly your left with a handful of memories

There's wooden walls
Combusting time
Those hammering sounds call again
Ring the bell inside my head
The liquid in my head

If I stand perfectly still and remember the jokes
And friends and folks
Like a scrapbook scraping the depths of my brain

We'll sit in space all day
And your childhood fears will drift away
And suddenly your left with a handful of memories

There's wooden walls
Combusting time
Those hammering sounds call again
Ring the bell inside my head
The liquid in my head
