FF ("double eff")
Transcribed by Indy Mike!


Basically it sounds like C in the 3rd fret position so you can easily slide into the Bb during the main part then
during the chorus reverse it to Bb---C and then hit a full on F which you can listen for the placement during
the Chorus.


C       Bb  C         Bb
When I grow up I will be a bigger kid
looking back I'll be proud of what I did.
Many times oh it seems we lose sight
for we are all still children deep inside.
As a child, life was cool
As a child, life was cool
As a child, oh man I'll tell you, I am free
As a child, oh man I'll tell you, I am me.

Bb        C      Bb         C              Bb
I want to runaway, to get up get out this town and sing
Bb       C           F (let it ring)
I say we make no plans

(repeat Bb---C for the rest of the chorus)

I want to unpack all your bags and we can live
I want to runaway (let F ring again)
We could puff all day long
we could build stuff all day long
we could jump and dance and laugh and sing
and walk or runaway
I want to runaway
I want to runaway, to get up get out this town and sing
I say we make no plans
I want to unpack all your bags and we can live.
