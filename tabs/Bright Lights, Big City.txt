Eb7
Bright lights, big city
All night, are you ready
Cat Fight, what a pity
Sex hype, nitty gritty

F#7                                  E7 F7 F#7
You are the one that I'm pointing to,
Come here and give me some

Eb7
Mouse trap, on your body
Groupies, in the lobby
Cold Cash, In your pocket
Cool Vibes, in your socket

F#7                             E7 F7 F#7
Open the lock to my bedroom door
See what its all about

Eb7
Long drives on the freeway
Cop Lights in your driveway
Long rides on the airway
All night on the runway


Then the bridge goes Eb > B 2 times, use palm muting on the repeated bass notes,
then Bb, then repeat that 3 times, then back to the main riff


Long drives on the freeway
Cop Lights in your driveway
Long rides on the airway
All night on the runway

This is the chance i've been waiting for
Better get out of my way

Cab ride to the whiskey
Blue ice make you frisky
Strobe light on your body
All night eatin sushi

Someday you'll know ill be wantin more
More than the streets can put out

Bright lights, Big City
All night, are you ready
Cat Fight, what a pity
Sex hype, nitty gritty
You've got the strut Ive been dreamin about
Cuttin the crowd like some bread
