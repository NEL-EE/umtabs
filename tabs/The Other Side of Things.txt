Verse
|: G > F :| (5/4 time)

Open up your eyes don't even close them for a moment
You could step in line and simply fall down by the wayside
Open up your eyes don't even close them for a moment
You could step in line and simply fall down by the wayside

Look into yourself and find your own and breathe your own breath
Life is much too short to always follow never leading
Look into yourself and find your own and breathe your own breath
Life is much too short to always follow never leading

Chorus
|: G > F > C :| (6/8 time)

If only I had more time (...the other side of things)
To look and then to find (does everything...)
If only I had more time
To look and then to find
